Arcade Game
===============================
## Getting Started

Welcome and thanks for wanting to play a mock-up of the classic frogger game. First things first, please feel free to clone or download the game files. To do so you will see a green rectangle button about 1/3 of the way down on the page to your far right that says "clone or download", click that button and you will be given two options. The easiest is to download zip and then once downloaded right click the file and extract the files. Once that is done open the folder and locate the index.html file, this file will load the game locally.

## Player Controls 

These are the player controls:

Arrow Up key: Move player up
Arrow Down key: Move player down
Arrow Left key: Move player left
Arrow Right key: Move player right

## Object of the Game

The object of the game is to reach the water. On your way to the water you'll notice giant bugs crossing the screen,
don't get hit by a bug or your player will start back to the beginning. Upon reaching the water your player will start back to the beginning.

## Next steps

Upon cloning or coping these files you have your own frogger type game. Please feel free to add cool features and make it your own...have fun and happy coding!
